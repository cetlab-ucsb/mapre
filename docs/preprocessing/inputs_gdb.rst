===============================================
Creating preprocessing inputs geodatabase (GDB)
===============================================

This part has to be done using ArcGIS. All inputs data (as detailed in the Data section) should be collected and added to a single inputs geodatabase (gdb) file for ease and convenience.

Creating a .gdb file in ArcGIS
==============================

If you already have a .gdb file, you can simply add it and link it to your project.

Adding rasters to the gdb
=========================

Adding rasters to the gdb requires the use of the *Copy Raster* tool in ArcGIS.

Adding shapefiles and others to the gdb
=======================================

To add a feature class to the .gdb, right click on the .gdb in the Catalog View, hover over "Import", and click on "Feature class".
