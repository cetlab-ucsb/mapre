After you've completed the preprocessing stage, you are ready to conduct the Analysis portion, which involves running five scripts that will assist you in your decision about where to place renewable energy plants in your area.

There are three approaches to provide inputs for these analysis scripts:

1. Using CSV files as inputs
2. Typing the inputs into the .py script directly
3. Using the ArcGIS Toolbox

Each approach are explained in further detail in the *Input approaches for analysis scripts* subsection.
